First CNN
==========

This repository contains my first attempt at building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The model is designed to classify images of cats and dogs.​

 Project Overview
-------------------

*   **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    
*   **Dataset**: Cats and Dogs images
    
*   **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
    
*   **Notebook**: dog\_and\_cat\_cnn.ipynb
    

The project includes data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training, and evaluation.​



 Results
----------

After training, the model achieves satisfactory accuracy in classifying cats and dogs. Evaluation metrics and sample predictions are included in the notebook.​
